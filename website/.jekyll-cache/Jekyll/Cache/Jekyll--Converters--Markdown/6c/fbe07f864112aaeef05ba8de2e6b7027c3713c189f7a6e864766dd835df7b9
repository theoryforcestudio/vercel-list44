I"ó<p><strong>Decentralization is one of the words you would hear from crypto OGs all the time. In 2022 iteration of crypto markets, it is talked about less, but that does not make it less important.</strong></p>

<p>If you are thinking of investing in cryptos today - it is important to understand what decentralization in crypto means, why itâ€™s so crucial and who does the actual work behind all of these decentralized solutions. Also there will be a bonus lesson for those brave enough to read till the end.</p>

<h2 id="decentralization">Decentralization</h2>

<p>In a world where everything gets centralized more and more, crypto not only offers a unique alternative with its decentralized functionality - but also allows people from around the globe to join forces and build something from nothing via different programs built on top of blockchain technology. In general - decentralization can be defined as:  Decentralization is the process of distributing or dispersing functions, powers, people or things away from a central location or authority.</p>

<h2 id="decentralized-exchanges-vs-centralized-exchanges">Decentralized exchanges vs centralized exchanges</h2>

<p>If you want to buy cryptos, your best bet would be on decentralized crypto exchange like IDEX (decentralized Ethereum exchange). It is an interface that allows you to trade Ether for other ERC20 tokens (tokens running on ethereum blockchain). No one can freeze your funds or take them away from you.</p>

<p>On the other hand - there are also totally centralized crypto exchanges like Binance , Bitfinex â€¦ You send them some money and they credit it to your account. Then if you want to sell cryptocurrencies - they will ask you to send some coins back for example.</p>

<h3 id="traders-prefer-centralized-trading">Traders prefer centralized trading</h3>

<p>The advantages of trading on centralized platforms is that itâ€™s much cheaper, and the experience is usually smoother. Also, centralized platforms are basically just books, they donâ€™t handle the actual money, so there is less losses through technical hiccupsâ€¦.But more losses through platform breaches.</p>

<p>The best part of all decentralized exchanges (for now) is that no one controls them and everyone can take a look at their code. They are truly transparent and sell themselves as way more secure than centralized ones because there is no central point of failure.</p>

<p>On the other hand - if you decide to join some application running on top of ethereum network, youâ€™ll need to be able to run it yourself since no one else will do it for you.</p>

<p>So in most cases when people talk about decentralization in crypto they mean this:  No single person or entity possesses sole power over the network.</p>

<p>Meaning anyone can take part in decision making processes (if something like that exist), anyone can improve the network and make it better.</p>

<h2 id="who-does-the-actual-work-behind-all-those-decentralized-solutions">Who does the actual work behind all those decentralized solutions?</h2>

<p>A lot of pure crypto enthusiasts with a passion for promoting decentralization and solve all those different problems. People who were driven by this idea and wanted to fix things (like buying/selling cryptos) weâ€™re currently experiencing on centralized platforms, bring more transparency to market and give people an opportunity to take part in decision making process.</p>

<p>Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) - they exist as complex smart contracts that automatically govern and regulate how everyone is supposed to behave on their network. They allow you to vote on issues directly related to the project, such as protocol changes or funding proposals .</p>

<p>But it would be a lie to say that in 2022, the decentralization initiative is not commercial. It is <em>very</em> commercial.  It is commercialized to the point where it even attracts people who are not too enthusiastic about cryptocurrencies in general, but see decentralized applications as a potentially profitable business model. And theyâ€™re right, because these Dapps have users, and those users pay money that can be turned into profit .</p>

<p>But all of this is still very young and growing quickly. The age will come when everything will start making more sense for everyone including businesses.</p>
