Crypto marketing is an emerging keyword, just like most related queries in the crypto niche. According to Ahrefs, it has 250 monthly searches on the US market, but already medium-high difficulty to rank for.

That *should* mean that there are many marketing agencies competing for attention in this niche.

However, when you look at the search engine results page, you will understand what's going on: There's pages like coinmarketcap mixed in. It appears that Google is for now mingling concepts of "market" and "marketing".

Anyway, here is the top of the SERP retrieved in Jan 2022.


1. A company landing page: Single grain is a niche specific agency.

I have omitted the off-results like coinmarketcap. Fiverr and gig jobs like that are at the bottom of the first page.

### Some comments to the SERP

As you can see, the SERP is so far dominated by new companies. Emerging outfits for emerging industry!

It is surprising that there are no big marketing and PR giants on the first page, or not even any "legacy" small agencies.

The only non-niche result is position 2, the list.

Possibly the small outfits are trying their luck in sub-niches, as seen [here in SEO for crypto businesses](https://www.altcointrading.net/cryptocurrency-seo-marketing-2022/). If you look at crypto SEO terms, you will get a different picture.

### General comments on the industry

Crypto enthusiasts have been called many things since they started getting loud online. Why is this?

Cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology behind them are emerging as a very disruptive force in the financial system, such that it has disrupted more than just banking institutions. It has also taken on governments and established institutions such as media, content creation industries and even politics itself.

This change isn't just affecting institutions, but also individuals who find themselves at risk of losing their jobs to new technologies so advanced they seem like science fiction only a few years ago. Old-school businesses and legislators alike have scrambled to both adapt and control these disruptive technologies while making sure they still maintain their grip on power throughout the transition period while slowly replace fiat money for large transactions with cryptocurrencies.

These fundamental changes are happening faster than most people thought possible, within the last decade. If you would have asked them to predict how fast it would take for these technologies to transform our lives completely, the answer probably "a generation" at least - meaning roughly 30 years or more. Governments are also getting increasingly nervous about this change because they see their power slipping away from them while they cannot stop nor control this outflow of information and value transfer. It sounds like a dystopia, but this is very real and just one country after another has tried to ban Bitcoin in its early stages only to learn that you cannot legislate against math.

This growing mistrust between government institutions and cryptocurrencies will eventually reach fever pitch where large countries will either ban cryptocurrencies, or try to shut down the blockchain technology behind them completely. The most powerful institutions in the world are not too eager to lose their grip on fiscal policy, and they will try everything they can in order to keep it that way even though this might mean an open warfare with privacy-loving crypto enthusiasts who want nothing more than for this technology to succeed.

These privacy-loving crypto fans have been christened as the bad guys ever since they started getting vocal online. They are considered criminals by large institutions, terrorists by some governments and troublemakers by big businesses trying desperately to fight back the tide of change while also doing their best not to profit from it at least initially.

This is where many people stop following what's going on and move on with their life. Well, the choice is yours, but maybe you are missing out on something. It is true that cryptocurrencies gave the space to many a scammer, but they also created opportunities for people who had been marginalized, discriminated against or who have been unable to work due to illness and disability. Those cases are possibly more rare than the average get-rich-quick bro case, but some argue that even if there is just a few of them, it makes it all worth it.
